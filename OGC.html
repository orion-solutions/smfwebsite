		<h1>About Orion</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Orion eSports is a multi-game competetive club that is owned by SMF.<br />
			Orion was created by players who loved gaming and the social aspects<br />
			it can bring to the table. Our players are skilled in multiple areas of different games.<br />
			The main games played by OGC are League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive<br />
			and Gigantic. More games will most likely be added in the future.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Currently, SMF owns OGC and sponsors them. Orion plays in tournaments in communities<br />
			such as Faceit and CEVO for CS:GO and CL (Compete League) for League of Legends. Our players<br />
			are not the best players but are improving every day and will one day have the potential to go<br />
			into the professional scene.</p>
