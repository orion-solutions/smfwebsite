            Hello everyone! Today, we're releasing this article to talk about our website! As you know, we're a startup company and we are looking to make a name for ourselves and our brand. Now, the first step to doing that, is of course, with a website.
            With this website, we have many exciting things. We made a unique logo to express ourselves with the brand, and we made the layout as neat and simplistic as possible without sacrificing functionality. In doing this, we learned some things about the code that we write.
            When Macky began writing the first pages for this website, he realized he didn't know half of what he was doing, so he sought to fix that by taking classes on the matter. And now, he can write code to match a professional who's been doing this for half his life.
            While we understand that this will not reach many people at first, we're hoping to get our name out there a bit with business cards and advertisments. The adverts we will run will not be intrusive because we understand how annoying some ads can be and we don't want
            that for our potential clients. We want to make the best impression possible with people. This article is one way we're trying to do that.
        </p>

        <h2 id="second-lead">Who built it?</h2>

        <p id="second-paragraph">
            This website was constructed solely by the two founders: ShockEMP and Macky. They collaborated on this site to make something that they both believed in. SM Freelancing is the culmination of their belief that to do something with your life
            you have to make something out of it first. While they had constructive criticism along the way, ultimately they prevailed without a hitch and this is the result that you see today! If you'd like to read more about the creative process of building this site, you
            can look at our Facebook page <a href="http://www.facebook.com/smfreelancing" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>here!</strong></a>
