    <p>SMF is a freelancing organization, we're fairly new to the competition but we're looking to make a<br />
    name for ourselves in the market of web development. They way we like to do things is fairly simple, we<br />
    work on a project to project basis until we can get more freelancers working for us. We accept any projects<br />
    you have to offer us and our pricing reflects that. Most of the time, the pricing depends on the type of<br />
    work we're going to be doing because some languages require more time to work on than others (looking at you JS).<br />
    But we always get our projects finished within a reasonable amount of time. If you are looking for someone with<br />
    experience on MySQL, we have Vulcan, who is in the process of learning it and if you're looking for JavaScript, we<br />
    have ShockEMP and Macky who are both partially experienced in the field. Currently, our strongest languages are HTML5,<br />
    CSS3, and JavaScript with some Python and Ruby mixed in. Currently, we don't have anyone learning Perl but that may soon<br />
    change if demand increases. Our goal is currently to provide our clients with the necessary elements to manage a website<br />
    while we also offer web management. The webmaster is Macky, who has the experience required to maintain your website<br />
    if the need is there. Web management can be requested through our Contact forms on the next page if that's what you're<br />
    looking for. Thank you for visiting the official SMF website and we hope you consider us for your next website.</p>

    <p>We are glad that you've taken the time to come visit us and are very grateful!<br />
    SM Freelance is a freelancing organization as the name suggests where we look<br />
    for work in the field of web development and design. Within SM Freelance, we<br />
    have the two founding members, ShockEMP and Macky. ShockEMP is an Oklahoma native<br />
    and is the reason that this was started. Macky is a Michigan native with a passion<br />
    for coding, and is the second founding member.</p>

    <h2>Goals and Ambitions</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to provide exceptional services to our clients.<br />
    One way we do that is by being completely transparent with every single<br />
    aspect of the project including allowing our clients to see partial source code<br />
    We want you to feel safe hiring us, which is why we are transparent with our work.</p>

    <p>Our main ambition is to be a main competetor in the freelancing market. We want to show people that we are<br />
    worth hiring to do important jobs.</p>
