        <h1 id="smfdescription">What we're about</h1>
        <p id="about-smf">SMF is a freelancing organization, we're fairly new to the competition but we're looking to make a<br /> name for ourselves in the market of web development. They way we like to do things is fairly simple, we<br /> work on a project to project basis until we can get more freelancers working for us. We accept any projects<br /> you have to offer us and our pricing reflects that. Most of the time, the pricing depends on the type of<br /> work we're going to be doing because some languages require more time to work on than others (looking at you JS).<br /> But we always get our projects finished within a reasonable amount of time. If you are looking for someone with<br /> experience on MySQL, we have Vulcan, who is in the process of learning it and if you're looking for JavaScript, we<br /> have ShockEMP and Macky who are both partially experienced in the field. Currently, our strongest languages are HTML5,<br /> CSS3, and JavaScript with some Python and Ruby mixed in. Currently, we don't have anyone learning Perl but that may soon<br /> change if demand increases. Our goal is currently to provide our clients with the necessary elements to manage a website<br /> while we also offer web management. The webmaster is Macky, who has the experience required to maintain your website<br /> if the need is there. Web management can be requested through our Contact forms on the next page if that's what you're<br /> looking for. Thank you for visiting the official SMF website and we hope you consider us for your next website.</p>

        <p id="mid-pitch">We are glad that you've taken the time to come visit us and are very grateful!<br /> SM Freelance is a freelancing organization as the name suggests where we look<br /> for work in the field of web development and design. Within SM Freelance, we have the two founding members, ShockEMP and Macky. ShockEMP is an Oklahoma native<br /> and is the reason that this was started. Macky is a Michigan native with a passion<br /> for coding, and is the second founding member.</p>

        <h2 id="goals">Goals and Ambitions</h2>
        <p id="goals-amb">Our goal is to provide exceptional services to our clients.<br /> One way we do that is by being completely transparent with every single<br /> aspect of the project including allowing our clients to see partial source code<br /> We want you to feel safe hiring us, which is why we are transparent with our work.</p>

        <p id="amb">Our main ambition is to be a main competitor in the freelancing market. We want to show people that we are worth hiring to do important jobs.</p>

        <h1 id="abf">About the Founders</h1>

        <div id="about-macky">
            <h2 id="abf">Malachi Austin (Macky)</h2>

            <p id="about-m">First up we have Macky.<br /> Macky isn't really the collaborative type of person. Macky does not get along well with peers and at the current age of 15 as of writing this, Shock is currently<br /> his only friend. ;)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about-shock">
            <h2 id="abf">Meakoda Wilson (ShockEMP)</h2>

            <p id="about-s">Second on the list, we have Meakoda, better known as ShockEMP.<br /> Meakoda is very intelligent and sometimes forces Macky's hand in problematic situations but that's also what somewhat keeps them together. Shock and Macky are the<br /> two founding members along with Vulcan and Lagoon as secondaries. More on them below.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about-vulcan">
            <h2 id="abf">Micheal Sallee (Vulcan)</h2>

            <p id="about-v">Vulcan is the third founding member as a secondary.<br /> Vulcan currently doesn't know very much code but is learning as we move along. At the time of writing this, Vulcan is 14 and is planning<br /> on working with us as long as he can.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about-lagoon">
            <h2 id="abf">Matthew Sallee (Lagoon)</h2>

            <p id="about-l">Lagoon is similar to Macky...<br /> In the regard that neither of them work well with others. This can sometimes lead to debates/arguments between the two of them<br /> and they can sometimes become heated but almost always, the conflict is resolved due to the nature of their friendship.</p>
